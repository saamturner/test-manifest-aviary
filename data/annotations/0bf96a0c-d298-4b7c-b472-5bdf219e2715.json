          "text": "My last leave was for Christmas 1938. I spent it at my mother's. Most Jews were very proud of me for two reasons. First because someone from Gora Kalwaria was in Light-cavalry and second because I was only a tailor. I was a very good soldier and was well respected and even once I was set as an example for others because of the way I rode a horse. I was section leader and besides the sabre I also had an RKM, a machine gun.\n\nSince March 1939 there were no more leaves. We felt that the situation  was not good. I wrote letters to my mother (but she did not get my last ones). All Jews were afraid of the situation and a lot of them emigrated to Russia. \n\nOf course nobody backed up Stalin and his crimes because this was genocide but at least some Jews who had decided to go there, survived while in Poland the situation was different. I have survived because I had been given the address of the Pokorskis and hid there. \n\nI did not marry before W.W.II. About 150 people emigrated from Gora Kalwaria, about 30 returned from U.S.S.R.\n"

On September 1 during breakfast we were told that the war had started and on the same day Suwalki railroad station was bombed. We were not allowed to undress and the next night we were ordered to go towards Kaliningrad. We reached a small village Reus (now Cimochy) and it was a German territory. We left the horses and entered on foot. There was a club, Germans were dancing and there were no guards. One of us threw a hand-grenade, there was panic and we took two German prisoners. I was an interpreter. We  stayed there for a few hours and following orders went back. It was difficult because German planes bombed all day long so we had  to hide in forests and marched only during the night. We marched east towards Zambrow, about Sept 11 or 10, we fought Germans, one of us died but we had horses and the regiment was intact. On Sept 13, in Olszewo we fought Germans again and about 20 of our soldiers were killed {several near Zambrow, cannot verify which one}. The commandant of the regiment was hurt, I was hurt too in the back of my neck, hand and leg and my immediate  commandant, officer cadet Glusek died, two meters away from me.\n"

          "text": "I was not fit for combat any more and I was taken to the doctor and  sent to the transport and supply columns which went  to Hrodna (while the regiment went further and fought near Kock on October 5). My columns reached Shchuchyn Nowogrodzki and then we were disarmed by the Russian Army. Major Diaczenko let us free to go and since it was impossible to back to Warsaw we went east. It was on September 17 when U.S.S.R began war with Poland. We  knew about it, but it was a surprise. Our commandant Witkowski told us not to fight Russians. I was taken by the Red Army and kept prisoner in Sztucin, near Lida. We were interned and later we planted forests near Minsk and later were exchanged. Germans and Poles (if they wanted to) could go back while Russians took Byelorussians and Ukrainians.\n\nThe exchange was between Russia and Germany in December so I had been interned in U.S.S.R, forty kilometres behind Minsk for a few months. There we cut and planted forests. If one cut or planted a set norm one got his food, nothing special but there was bread, soup coffee and fish cans so the conditions were not so bad, taking into account that we were prisoners. Russians treated me in the same way as others. I was not able to meet my norm requirements so two colleagues from Silesia helped me and so I was able to get dinner as well. \n\nTill December 1939 I did not have news from Poland, no letters. I knew that Warsaw had capitulated because Russians told us about it. They used to say that they were taking us prisoners \"for the time being\" but later we would fight Germans together. \n"

I went by train, from  Bialystok to Lapy to Warsaw and Gora Kalwaria. Jews and Poles came to ask how it had been.\n\nThere were Germans in Gora Kalwaria, there were a lot of volksdeutche [ people who claimed they had German ancestors\nand were treated as semi-Germans]. Volksdeutche immediately entered the black police. Jews between 16 and 60 years old were forced to work.  A young Jewish boy, Moszek Cybula was killed by Germans for taking a piece of bread, similarly Germans killed Pinierawski who was leaving a synagogue. Zaddik from Gora Kalwaria had been taken to Warsaw by Jews and protected by them {Abraham Mordecai Alter- EJ}. He was kept in a shoe-shop because craftsmen were relatively safe at that  time. Later Italian Embassy helped and he was taken to Triest due to the influence by a Pole, Stefan Porajski (a cousin of the President Moscicki) who worked at the Italian Embassy. He procured papers for the Zaddik and in autumn 1942 the zaddik and his family left Warsaw  for Rome in a specially ordered train car. He reached Triest.\n\nSome believers were disappointed at his departure but other Jews, especially those who had helped him to go to Warsaw on a  raft (on the Wisla [Vistula] river) were glad because Germans as soon as they entered Gora Kalwaria started looking for him.\n"

My mother told me I should have written to her and she would have told me not to come back. I stayed in Gora Kalwaria for a year and on February 25 and  26 1941 Jews were ordered to go to Warsaw ghetto (EJ). Before they  had lived in the ghetto in Gora Kalwaria since July 1940. Before the ghetto Poles and Jews had lived together were allowed to leave the town, buy food etc., but Jews were forced to work, German mayor Jenke decided how many would go to work and Judenrat [Jewish Council] decided who would go to work. It was the same as in other places in Poland. Judenrat was appointed by Germans and its members were threatened with death if they did not follow German orders. Judenrat selected people, they were to come at 7 o'clock and wait till Germans come to take them to various parts  of the town to perform all dirty chores like cleaning toilets, stables, etc. The sick and old did not go to work.\n\nApart from my forced work I also worked as a tailor. Catholics would come to me and I would make clothes for them for not much money. My mother was old so she was not taken to work. She stayed at home and sewed but later it was forbidden. \n\nPeople were hungry in Gora Kalwaria from the beginning because 80% had been very poor before W.W.II. Craftsmen were in the remaining 20%, we had maybe 5 or 6 rich people. Judenrat organized soup for the poor, whoever wanted it but it was not much. "
